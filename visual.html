                                        Analysis of Bike Demand</h1>
                                    <h4>Extracts from the report</h4>
									<p>The study of MLP and SVM models demonstrated that SVM model is more suitable for the prediction of heart failures.<br />
										Based on the hyperparameters and the performance of the model, the initial hypothesis was correct. The secondary metric result was also good in SVM model, which means it can be tried in the wild.</p>

								<p>The demand for the bike sharing services has increased over the years and the most popular season is summer. In addition to this, I have identified the peak of the usage, which was in August 2017 and the month closest to it with least demand was December 2016.</p>
                                <p class='image main'><img src="images/august_2017.jpg" alt="">Test results from MLP (left) Test results from SVM (right)</p>
								<p>The analysis of August and December showed that the demand to go to the city centre has not changed and it is still the most popular place to travel to. However, the demand of other stations not close to the city centre changes over time.</p>

                                <p>The analysis of the factors that affect the demand of services has showed that less people are willing to take bikes during storm weather. It is also supported by median of duration of those trips as they are close to other weather states.</p>
